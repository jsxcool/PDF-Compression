Deflate:
   Each type of value (literals, distances, and lengths) in the
   compressed data is represented using a Huffman code, using one code
   tree for literals and lengths and a separate code tree for distances.
   The code trees for each block appear in a compact form just before
   the compressed data for that block.
   
zlib:
   The zlib format has a very small header of only two bytes to identify it as a zlib stream and to provide decoding information, and a four-byte trailer with a fast check value to verify the integrity of the uncompressed data after decoding.
